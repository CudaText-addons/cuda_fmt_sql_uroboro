Formatter for SQL (lexer name can be any starting with "SQL").
Ported from Sublime Text plugin.

Uses uroboroSQL Python lib:
  https://github.com/future-architect

UroboroSQL is often used in enterprise systems, for formatting to a highly maintainable style even for very long SQL.
In particular, in countries where English is not their mother tongue, such as Japan, comments may be included in SELECT clauses. In that case, we will align the vertical position of the AS clause and the comment, pursuing the viewability which can be said as artistic anymore, This was developed to realize this automatically.

--- In case of general formatter
SELECT MI.MAKER_CD AS ITEM_MAKER_CD -- メーカーコード
,
       MI.BRAND_CD AS ITEM_BRAND_CD -- ブランドコード
,
       MI.ITEM_CD AS ITEM_CD -- 商品コード
,
       MI.CATEGORY AS ITEM_CATEGORY -- 商品カテゴリ
FROM M_ITEM MI -- 商品マスタ

WHERE 1 = 1
  AND MI.ARRIVAL_DATE = '2016-12-01' -- 入荷日
